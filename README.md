# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular game 2048 built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to merge tiles of the same number to reach the highest score possible.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles on the game board. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two numbers. The game ends when the board is full and no more moves can be made.
